\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}
We studied how to uncover ailment distributions over time in social
media.  We proposed a granularity-based model to conduct
region-specific analysis that leads to the identification of time
intervals characterizing homogeneous ailment discourse, per region.
We modeled disease evolution within each homogeneous
region and attempted to predict ailments.  The fine-grained nature of
our model results in significant improvements over state of the art
methods.  %% We envisage a use case where our ailment predictions can
%% replace existing solutions for syndromic surveillance that
%% are both costly and time consuming.
